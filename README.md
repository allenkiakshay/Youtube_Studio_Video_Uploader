# Cohesive Video Uploading: Empowering YouTube Channel Owners and Collaborators
This functionality serves as a valuable tool for YouTube channel owners, streamlining the video uploading process to their channels.

To utilize this feature, users are prompted to form dedicated teams or groups, fostering a collaborative environment for content creation.

When a video is uploaded by a team member, such as an editor or a designated role, an additional layer of security is introduced through OTP verification. This verification step is designed to confirm the identity of the channel owner. Once the owner successfully completes the OTP verification, the system smoothly orchestrates the video's upload to the designated YouTube channel.
